# REST and SOAP API testing via Postman

During this block of the course all methods for https://petstore.swagger.io/ were tested. 
You can find the result in this [Postman collection](https://www.postman.com/red-water-132857/workspace/my-workspace/collection/31085057-11bf3b94-9834-453f-8921-f2bc1fb7be92?action=share&creator=31085057&active-environment=31085057-a28dee1a-1ef5-428f-8d6d-ac11f6504332).

I also made [test cases for the "store" block](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1diu-2DP2Iusc7LlLLmEDXl97T3FiRMoLOJozGPqA-tY/edit#gid=0) of the resource mentioned above.
